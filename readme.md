# Resiliz Corporate Website

This repository contains the source code for the Resiliz corporate website.

## Overview

The website is a single-page, responsive application designed to showcase Resiliz's expertise in enterprise software solutions, AI integration, and cloud architecture.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling (loaded via CDN).
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Lightweight interactivity (Carousel, Mobile Menu, Form Validation).
- **FontAwesome**: Icons.
- **Google Fonts**: Typography (Inter).

## Structure

- `index.html`: The main entry point containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Deployment

This site is ready for deployment on GitHub Pages or any static hosting service. Simply serve the `index.html` file.

## Editing

To make changes, edit `index.html`. The CSS is handled via Tailwind's CDN for instant prototyping, but for production scaling, consider setting up a build process if custom CSS grows significantly.
